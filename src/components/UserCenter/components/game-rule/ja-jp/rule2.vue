      Live betting means betting on an ongoing game. Bets will continue to be
      accepted during the game and will stop when the market is closed. Note:
      Regardless of whether the event has started or not, as long as the
      market is displayed as Live, the system will tag all bets as live bets.

    <div style="padding: 14px 14px 14px 40px">
      a. All live bets are subject to a system acceptance process. This may
      result in the delay of confirmation or rejection of bets.
    </div>
    <div style="padding: 14px 14px 14px 40px">
      b. All bets will undergo a system acceptance process within 30 seconds
      to determine whether the bet is successful. This process will result in
      either the confirmation or cancellation of such bets.

    <div style="padding: 14px 14px 14px 40px">
      c. In the event that technical problems or any other unforeseen
      circumstances occur during a match, all pending bets will not be
      confirmed and will be rejected.

      b. In the event that the game is replayed due to unforeseen
      circumstances or force majeure on a single map, all settled results
      shall still remain valid, and the bets on the unsettled results shall be
      based on the result of the rematch. The replayed game/map shall be
      treated as a separate, thus the affected live bets will be cancelled and
      refunded.
